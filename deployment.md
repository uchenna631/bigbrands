<br><br>
The project was deployed to Heroku with the following steps:

1. create a  [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/) account and log in.
1. On the New tab click on "create new app" then name the app and choose a region for it.
1. On the resources tab search for Heroku Postgres in the Add-ons input. submit order form.
1. In the settings tab click on ```Reveal Config Vars```. This will reveal the DATABASE_URL key.
1. Copy key into your env.py file and link it to your project thus. and also copy your Django secret key into the Heroku Config Vars.
```
import os

os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = 'xxxxxxxx'
os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = 'xxxxxxxx'
```
and in the settings.py add the below code.
```
import os
import dj_database_url
if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
    import env
```
comment out the sqlite db and link the heroku database using this code:
```
 DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }
```
6. Run Migrations:
```
 python3 manage.py migrate
 ```
7. Then load all fixtures data:
 in products and blog app
 ```
 python3 manage.py loaddata "fixture_file_name"
 ```
8. on the CLI create a requirements.txt file using the command:
 ```
 pip3 freeze -â€“local > requirements.txt
 ```
9.	Add a Procfile with the required codes in it: ```web: gunicorn bigbrands.wsgi:application```
10.	Change Debug to False and commit repository to Github.

11. On the Heroku app setting Config Vars add: ```DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1```
12. On the deploy tab connect your github account and search for the github repository with the name you saved it. click connect to link the repo to heroku.
10. Scroll down and setup automatic deploy to allow Heroku to update app from gitpod push and click on the manual deploy option.

##### Connect Django to S3
Install the following two packages;
"""
pip3 install boto3
"""
"""
pip3 install django-storages
"""
then set up the S3 bucket as thus:
```
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'picknstrum'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'eu-west-1'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

    # Static and media files
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
    STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
    MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

    # Override static and media URLs in production
    STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
    MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
```
Add the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY from the downloaded CSV file to the Heroku Config Vars and delete the ```DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1```
6. add and commit your project and push to heroku this will trigger a deployment activity.
& in the S3 bucket add a Media folder and upload all your media files to it.

### EMAIL Services

EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
